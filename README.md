# Quantitative-Trading-Algorithms
This Repository consists of all the my personal trading algorithms that I use on a daily basis to analyze and invest in particular stocks. You can go on main.py to see
what investments I currently have in my portfolio. These same stocks plus more in the future will be used for my long-short, options, simple stream, and martingale
strategies.
